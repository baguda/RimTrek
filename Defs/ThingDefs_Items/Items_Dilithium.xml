		<description>Dilithium is an element, a member of the hypersonic series, primarily occurring as a crystalline mineral. It was used to control the power of the warp drive systems of many starships by regulating the matter-antimatter reaction in a ship's warp core because of its ability to be rendered porous to light-element antimatter when exposed to high temperatures and electromagnetic pressures. It controlled the amount of power generated in the reaction chamber, channeling the energy released by mutual annihilation into a stream of electro-plasma.</description>

        <description>{PAWN_nameDef} is a Vulcan from the alpha quadrant. Vulcans are masters of logic, so {PAWN_pronoun} is clearly superior to all other races. Indeed, {PAWN_nameDef} is a member of the chosen race. Like other Vulcans, {PAWN_nameDef} prefers to live among his own, but {PAWN_pronoun} is kind enough to use {PAWN_pronoun}'s talents to help the humans despite their primitive ways.</description>
